  Problems with console.log() in Production:
  Security Risk: It may expose sensitive data in logs visible to users (e.g., via browser dev tools).
  Performance Issues: Logging can slow down applications, especially in high-traffic environments.
  Lack of Log Levels: console.log() doesn't support structured logging or log levels for filtering messages.
  
  Use a Logging Library
    Instead of console.log(), use a structured logging library like:

    winston (popular for Node.js)
    pino (high-performance logger for Node.js)
    loglevel (lightweight logging for the browser)
