description: |
  In TypeScript, "any" allows a variable to hold any value without type checking, essentially disabling type safety, while "unknown" represents a value of unknown type but forces you to explicitly check and narrow its type before using it, promoting type safety; essentially, "any" is very flexible but less safe, while "unknown" is more restrictive but safer when dealing with uncertain data types
