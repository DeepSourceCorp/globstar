  DEBUG = True cannot be used in production in django framework.
  
  When DEBUG = True is enabled in Django, the framework provides detailed error messages, stack traces, and sensitive information about your application. While useful for development, this setting is dangerous in production because:

  ‚ùå Risks of DEBUG = True in Production
  - Sensitive Data Exposure

    - Django displays full error traces and environment variables, which might include database credentials, API keys, or secret tokens.
  - Security Vulnerabilities

    - Debug mode allows detailed error pages that could help attackers find weaknesses in your application.
    - It can expose internal file paths and configuration details.
  - Performance Issues

    - Debug mode can slow down your app by enabling extra logging and debugging tools that aren't needed in production.
